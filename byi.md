## b4 you interact !!
1. Since I'm not able to speak English natively, I don't have much knowledge of English-speaking memes, and I'm often late in replying.
2. 'Cause I have diagnosed severe ADHD, I generally tend to remain silent in order to restrain myself from acting impulsively. If you hope to talk with me, please whisper to me first!!
3. I'm guessing that my mental age is quite low because I have autism and severe ADHD. Even though I am restrained and careful about what I do, I can still unnecessarily upset someone or make an unexpected mistake. If this happened, I apologize and hope you understand. And please let me know or hide me if there's anything you're not good at with my my action. I'll try to avoid it as much as possible!!
4. Please refrain from saying that you made my (copied) skins yours.
5. I'm always in the kny area (bottom middle of the bazaar) in pt.
6.  I spend a lot of my real time drawing, so I might not be able to play pt for a few days or more. If I'm not online in pt but you hope to talk, please send me a friend request on Discord. Mine is **all4u_bron**!!
