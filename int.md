## about shippings !!
Please note that I would rather like to treat as just combis than as romantic shipping, because I personally don't think that every shipping necessarily has to have a typical view of love.

But in the case of proshipping, it goes without saying that the answer is NO.

With the above in mind, I love 🍃🌊, 🍃🐍, 🍃🍡, 🦋🍡, 🍃🐍🍡, 🍃🐍🌊(position doesn't matter)
